            <h2>Project 1</h2>
            <ul>
                <li> Name: Project 1</li>
                <li> Description:A full-stack web developer is an excellent example of this model as the developer has general knowledge across a wide breadth of technologies and platforms as well as in-depth experience and specialization in a couple of those concepts. For the most part, there are two general fields that make up a full-stack developer’s skillset: front-end development and back-end development. </li>

            <h2>Project 2</h2>
            <ul>
                <li> Name: Project 2</li>
                <li> Description:This skillset involves the actual presentation of your website—how the information in your website is laid out in browsers and on mobile devices as well. A dedicated front-end developer will be very experienced working with HTML and CSS as well as the scripting language, JavaScript. With these languages, the developer can very efficiently manipulate the information on a website to make it appealing and effective. </li>

            <h2>Project 3</h2>
            <ul>
                <li> Name: Project 3</li>
                <li> Description:Creation, edit/update and recollection of data are some of the processes that are most often associated with back-end development. Some examples of common scripting languages used are PHP, Ruby, and Python. With these languages, a back-end developer can create algorithms and business logic to manipulate the data that was received in front-end development. </li>
